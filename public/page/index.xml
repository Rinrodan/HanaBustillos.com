      <description>This is a blog for overwhelmed moms.
Moms who feel like they have made mistakes.
Moms who feel like they don’t know what they’re doing.
Moms who think they have failed their kids.
 This blog is a place for you to find rest, comfort, and solidarity. A place where you can get in touch with God, yourself, and your own wonderful, flawed humanity - as a mom and as a person.</description>
