I found that the format was not realistic for my life as a mom of three small children with limited free time. As a busy mom, I struggled to find time for myself amidst child care, homeschooling, laundry, grocery shopping, cleaning, and other daily tasks. I&amp;rsquo;m now on the hunt for a more flexible goal-setting method that works better for my busy schedule.</description>

      <description>The apostle Paul tells us to not only take care of our bodies, but also work on our spiritual fitness. He advises us to avoid negative influences and pursue godliness, which is valuable for both this life and the next.
