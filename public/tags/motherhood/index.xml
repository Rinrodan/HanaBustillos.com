      <description>Reflections on my experience with the 101 in 1001 goal-setting format. I found that the format was not realistic for my life as a mom of three small children with limited free time. As a busy mom, I struggled to find time for myself amidst child care, homeschooling, laundry, grocery shopping, cleaning, and other daily tasks. I&amp;rsquo;m now on the hunt for a more flexible goal-setting method that works better for my busy schedule.</description>

      <description>The apostle Paul tells us to not only take care of our bodies, but also work on our spiritual fitness. He advises us to avoid negative influences and pursue godliness, which is valuable for both this life and the next.

      <description>Mothers live in and through moments of strong emotions, both positive and negative.  It’s common for mothers to grapple with resentment, a constant feeling of imbalance, and the weight of unmet needs.
