      <description>The apostle Paul tells us to not only take care of our bodies, but also work on our spiritual fitness. He advises us to avoid negative influences and pursue godliness, which is valuable for both this life and the next. He also warns us that our journey will not be smooth sailing, and we have to face it with faith and hope in God, who is our Savior.</description>
