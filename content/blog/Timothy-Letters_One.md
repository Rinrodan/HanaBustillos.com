> "I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because he considered me faithful and appointed me to his service, even though I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a man of violence."
[1 Timothy 1:12-13][1 Timothy 1:12-13]

## Who Said I was Qualified for this?

&nbsp; &nbsp; There’s nothing quite like motherhood to make you feel like you’re unprepared and unqualified for a job.  Some moms are completely thrown by the intensity of the infant stage, some struggle with toddlers (we *ALL* struggle with toddlers), some are mystified by the inner workings of a teenager’s mind.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; Just when you think you have on stage figured out, they go through something else, or some tricky situation pops up, or hormones just go on a rampage, and you’re stuck wondering, “why did I think I could do this?”  Even with my third baby, I’ve found myself having days where I think, why is this so hard, and so overwhelming?

## Paul Felt the Same Way

&nbsp; &nbsp; In Paul’s letters, he often makes these kinds of remarks - pointing out that he is perhaps the least qualified guy for the job he has been given.  Yet we have a huge chunk of the Bible that shows us how passionate, relentless, and enthusiastic Paul was about the task God had assigned to him.

&nbsp; &nbsp; On days where you’re struggling, it’s important to remember that the job you are doing is hard.  It’s large-scale, multi-year, comprehensive work.  It’s complicated.  You may not feel qualified to do parts of it, and that’s okay.

## God Says You’re Ready

&nbsp; &nbsp; It’s also important to remember that, just like Paul, you have been appointed by God as the mother of your children.  This is a calling specific to you and your family, and that is a good thing.  You will have hard days, months, and years, but God is always with you on the journey.
