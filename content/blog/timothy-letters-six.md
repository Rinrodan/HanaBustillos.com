summary: "This blog post is about how moms can avoid getting distracted by things that are not important, like comparing themselves to others on social media or trying to win an argument in a comment section."

> Have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.  And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone, an apt teacher, patient, correcting opponents with gentleness.  God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth, and that they may escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.
[2 Timothy 2:22-25][verse]

&nbsp;&nbsp; Following up on last week’s post about how moms often feel the pressure to maintain a certain aesthetic (thanks instagram), we have this great bit of guidance and a reminder to focus on what’s important.  I like a good aesthetic as much as the next person, and I love scrolling social media for ideas for decor, gardening, interiors, all those beautiful things.  And I fully believe that making yourself and your home/garden/whatever into beautiful expressions of yourself and your values is a worthy pursuit.

&nbsp;&nbsp; There are times, though, and we’ve all had them, when we realize we’re all getting a little too caught up in it.  It can really be any form of social media, or even gossip or the friendly-but-maybe-not-so-friendly comparisons that happen at school, church, or other social functions.  We all know to stay out of the mess and nonsense, to seek out people with similar values, and just not worry about all the other stuff.  I think social media can make it especially difficult because it can be fairly easy to avoid talking to the neighborhood gossip, but it’s very easy to pick up your phone and compare yourself to all the perfectly curated content you see there.

&nbsp;&nbsp; This Scripture tells us literally to be kind and patient, and then just leave it in God’s hands (God may perhaps grant…), and let that be God’s business, not ours.  Instead, we can focus our hearts and heads on good things, on the calling(s) that God has given us.  Not just motherhood, though obviously that’s my main focus here, but on our relationships, our work, and whatever other pursuits we have that bring us joy and abundance.
