summary: "You have been gifted by God for motherhood and you have enough power, love, and self-discipline to overcome fears of being a bad mother. We are not alone in this journey and we can rely on God and those who care about us. You can do this with God's help and grace."

> For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands, for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.

[2 Timothy 1:6-7][verse]

&nbsp; &nbsp; This verse is such a simple, but powerful reminder that we have God-given gifts for motherhood.  It’s especially meaningful in the moments where we feel afraid or inadequate.  Those moments are plentiful in motherhood.  They can happen during the overwhelm of a new infant, chasing after a too-brave toddler on the playground, or the more complicated fears that come as our children grow.

## Fears of Being a Bad Mom

&nbsp; &nbsp; I’m only (roughly) six years into the gig and I feel like I’ve had enough feelings of fear and inadequacy for a lifetime.  Motherhood has served me many hot dishes of “what in the world is *this* and how can I possibly handle it?”  I have felt inadequate, bewildered, confused, and lost.  And I know there is much, much more to come.

&nbsp; &nbsp; When these scary situations pop up, we worry both about the present and the future.  How do I handle this situation?  What do I even do?  Who can I ask for help?  What if I didn’t handle it right?  What if they feel like now they can’t talk to me?  What if they’re traumatized?  Did I ruin their childhood?

These two little verses from 2 Timothy give us so much to help us confront these fears.

&nbsp; &nbsp; In the first half, just as Paul is reminding Timothy that he has gifts, he is also telling Timothy to make sure to “rekindle them” through the laying on of hands.  Whether that looks like an actual laying on of hands or not, it is a reminder that: **1)** You have God-given gifts and those gifts can be applied to motherhood, and **2)** It is important for you to seek out people, places, communities, and situations where you feel your gifts being rekindled and restored.  That can be church, for sure, but it can also be pursuing a hobby, having coffee with a friend, time with your spouse or partner, quiet prayer time, or whatever makes you feel rejuvenated.

## You Can Do This

&nbsp; &nbsp; The second half of this verse is so empowering.  God did not give you a spirit of cowardice.  That does not mean you can’t feel afraid or that you shouldn’t feel afraid.  The fact that you feel fear is probably a good indication that you are taking your job as a mom seriously and that is *good.*  It does mean that, in spite of your fear, and because you are gifted by God for this job, you have power, and love, and self-discipline on your side.  Basically it’s a reminder that yes, you can do it.

God gives us the tools we need to do this job - and that doesn’t mean we have to do it alone.  It doesn’t mean we don’t need help, rest, support, or time away.

It does mean that you are gifted by God in unique and wonderful ways.  You can do this.  You are doing it, and you are doing a great job.
