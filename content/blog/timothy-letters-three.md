summary: "The apostle Paul tells us to not only take care of our bodies, but also work on our spiritual fitness. He advises us to avoid negative influences and pursue godliness, which is valuable for both this life and the next. He also warns us that our journey will not be smooth sailing, and we have to face it with faith and hope in God, who is our Savior."

> Have nothing to do with profane and foolish tales.  Train yourself in godliness, for, while physical training is of some value, godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.  The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance.  For to this end we toil and suffer reproach, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.

[1 Timothy 4:7-10][verse]

&nbsp; &nbsp; I’ve written about practicing your faith around your children, and how it is such a gift to be able to model what a real-life relationship with God looks like to them.  This passage follows in the same vein.  It reminds us to “train” ourselves in godliness - to maintain spiritual fitness.

## Let go of the Negative

&nbsp; &nbsp; Part of “spiritual training” is getting rid of the negative things in your life - having “nothing to do with profane and foolish tales.”  Since becoming a mom, I’ve become a lot stricter with what I do and don’t let into my life.  Social media is a big one for a lot of us - restricting how much we use it and how much we let it impact us.  It could also be anything as simple as choosing to stop watching a tv show, or as complicated as going no contact with a family member.

## Keep What Builds

&nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever is bringing you down, making it harder for you to be the most authentic, joyful version of yourself - it’s okay to let that go.  That’s part of the training - cutting back on the things that don’t nourish us.  The other part of training is adding in the things that do nourish us.  Whatever it is - prayer, Bible study, alone time, maintaining important relationships, developing hobbies - all of that is important for us and important to our kids.

&nbsp; &nbsp; The second part of this passage is a little convoluted to read, but so meaningful nonetheless.  Paul writes about how we toil and suffer reproach, because we believe in Jesus.  So…hard work and being criticized.  I’ve been lucky to have lots of supportive, loving people in my life who reassure me that I am a good mom when I am doubting myself, but no mom gets through life without at least some criticism.  For some moms, it comes from people who should offer support instead, which is doubly hurtful.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Even if you have a supportive community, at some point, your kids are going to tell you that you have disappointed them.  Those are some of the worst, most painful, guilt-inducing moments of motherhood.

## Walk Humbly With Your God

&nbsp; &nbsp; This passage reminds us that all the work, and working through all the criticism (from whatever direction) can have a purpose.  That doesn’t mean you have to put up with nonsense, it just means that there is a purpose - a purpose to the choices we make as Christian mothers.  As we pursue a relationship with God for our own goodness and refinement, we also get to be living, breathing examples of God’s love to our kids.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Motherhood will humble you like nothing else - your children will humble you like nothing else.  The only perfect One is God.  And that’s okay - we’re not called to be perfect mothers.  We’re just called to do the best we can with what we’ve been given.  Humility is a part of the motherhood experience.  And even when we mess up, even when we’re feeling guilty and embarrassed, God still loves us and gives us a chance to do better.
