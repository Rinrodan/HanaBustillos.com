&nbsp;&nbsp; Motherhood comes with its share of struggles, and obviously that makes up most of my content.  However, it also comes with its share of joys, and most of the time, the joys outweigh the struggles with no contest.  This series is a little respite from the “hard stuff” that I write about.  It’s a time and space to celebrate the things that make raising children so wonderful.  A lot of it is mundane - everyday moments that pass by in a heartbeat, but stick with me forever.  A lot of them are universal - I’m sure you’ve shared many of the same experiences.

So here is volume one - a few of the Joys of Motherhood:

&nbsp;&nbsp; Grinning like a fool - watching your children having a good time at the park, or doing something really exciting like feeding giraffes at the zoo, and realizing that you have a huge smile on your face just watching them enjoy themselves.

The “kiss it better” stage, usually around 2 years old -  when they are literally fine but have to run to you to get a kiss on their boo-boo, and then run off as though miraculously healed.

When your baby starts “clinging” - actually holding onto your shoulder or your neck when you pick them up.

My infant who needs to HOLD HANDS in order to fall asleep.

After weeks of practice and failed attempts, watching my five-year-old bursting with joy and pride after conquering the monkey bars.
